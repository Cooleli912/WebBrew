# Introduction
I've created a method of homebrew that Nintendo can't fix. Yep, you heard me right, This works on any model of the switch, It's called WebBrew.

# Information
WebBrew is made and maintained at http://www.eelonline.us which is the website I own.
This is possibly the easiest exploit for the nintendo switch. and basically the only one for the switch lite and OLED.
__It Is limited to browser exploits, but with your code, we can change that.__
