# Introduction
I've created a method of homebrew that Nintendo can't fix. Yep, you heard me right, This works on any model of the switch, It's called WebBrew.

# Information
WebBrew is made and maintained at http://www.eelonline.us which is the website I own.
This is possibly the easiest exploit for the nintendo switch. and basically the only one for the switch lite and OLED.
__It Is limited to browser exploits, but with your code, we can change that.__

# Preparing
First of all, power on your device, then get into the __Secret Web Browser__, it has many tutorials and articles focusing on getting into it. this is possible on every firmware version, and every model of the Nintendo Switch.

# Running the exploit
Follow the __Preparing__ Guide before trying.

# Apps and Games
Right now there aren't any, but it will just be one button press to unlimited content soon enough!
